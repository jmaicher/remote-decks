Awesome remote decks are awesome!
=================================

A web application which allows to control deck.js slides remotely from a browser (desktop or mobile).

**Note**: This app has been created in a private hackathon within 24 hours with literally NO prior experiences with node.js and web sockets.

The intent of this app was 1) to try out node.js/web sockets and 2) to demo the capabilities of todays web applications in a presentation (which I totally rocked btw ;-).
