Awesome remote decks are awesome!
=================================

A web application which allows to control deck.js slides remotely from a browser (desktop or mobile).
The intent of this app was 1) to try out node.js/web sockets and 2) to demo the capabilities of todays web applications in a presentation (which I totally rocked btw ;-).
